# Title: Python Snowpark Formula1

## Work in Progress (WIP) Notice 
We will be iteratively updating this project for code cleanup, automation, and developing best practices. 
So far the list of future improvements is as follows:
- [ ]  yaml selectors for training and prediction; prediction only
- [ ]  codegen for the 8 staging files
- [ ]  label encorder clean up for numeric variables
- [ ]  ohe for the categorical variables
- [ ]  multi-class accuracy
- [ ]  trying out https://github.com/omnata-labs/dbt-ml-preprocessing for some of the pipeline?


## Project Description
A repo using open source Formula1 to show how dbt cloud combines 1) SQL and python 2) analytics and machine learning (ml). 
We are able to blend these together seamlessly using Snowpark for python on Snowflake.
